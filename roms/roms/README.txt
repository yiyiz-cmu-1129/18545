Notes:
-68k Bios goes into the 23128's on in the video microprocessor main memory
-68kl is bytes 0-0x7ffff of the program ROM
-68kh is bytes 0x80000-0x81fff of the program ROM
-Alpha goes into the 23128 in Alphanumerics
--Note this might be wrong, I put two 2**13 bit roms together to make this one
--I think that only the bottom 2**13 bits are valid
--Depends what the system expects when asserting ALBNK, maybe fill top bits with 0xFFs
-Banks go into the Graphics ROMs, 23256's, the plane is listed on the page, the bank chosen by GCSx
-Clock FPLA is the 82S153 in the clock and sync gen that generates VRAC, etc.
-Color AMD goes into the 27529 in Graphic Palette Select
-EEPROM goes into the 2804 in Non-Volatile Memory
-Prom1 and Prom0 go into the 82S129 in System Clock and Sync and Graphic Priority Control, respectively
--90% sure that prom1 goes into the clock, because it doesn't run with prom0
-Remap AMD goes into the 27529 in Graphic Bank and Picture Select
-Sound goes into the 23128s in Sound Program ROM
