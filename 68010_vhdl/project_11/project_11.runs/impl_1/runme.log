INFO: [Timing 38-191] Multithreading enabled for timing update using a maximum of 8 CPUs
WARNING: [Timing 38-313] There are no user specified timing constraints. Timing constraints are needed for proper timing analysis.
WARNING: [Power 33-232] No user defined clocks were found in the design!
Resolution: Please specify clocks using create_clock/create_generated_clock for sequential elements. For pure combinatorial circuits, please specify a virtual clock, otherwise the vectorless estimation might be inaccurate
